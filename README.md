#Is Crime Related to Economic Growth?
##Marissa Reuther
###December 2017

The goal of this project is to determine if there is any correlation between a recession and crime rates. In other words, is there more crime during a recession? One indicator of a recession is when Gross Domestic Product has a negative growth rate. I want to determine if there is any correlation between negative GDP growth rates and nine different classifications of crime. 

In order to do this, I have quarterly GDP data from the St. Louis FED and annual crime statistics from the FBI.
