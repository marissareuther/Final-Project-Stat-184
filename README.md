#Is Crime Related to Economic Growth?

##Marissa Reuther

###December 2017

The goal of this project is to determine if there is any correlation between a recession and crime rates. In other words, is there more crime during a recession? One indicator of a recession is when Gross Domestic Product has a negative growth rate. I want to determine if there is any correlation between negative GDP growth rates and nine different classifications of crime. 

In order to do this, I have [quarterly GDP data from the St. Louis FED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) and [annual crime statistics from the FBI](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/1tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_1_crime_in_the_united_states_by_volume_and_rate_per_100000_inhabitants_1994-2013.xls).
